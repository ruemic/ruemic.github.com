Because if it ain't fun, it won't get done
------------------------------------------

I've just switched my blog to Octopress after realizing that my previous setup was just way to much of a hassle to update. Basically, I was hand coding the html for each post.

One that was just way to much overhead. Lucky for me, some really smart folks have come up with a much better way to do it, that uses all the latest and greatest web dev tools.

Will post some more details soon...
